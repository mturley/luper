WARNING: DO NOT EXECUTE

The two SQL files in this directory:

  create_sqlite_tables.sql and
  drop_sqlite_tables.sql

are DESTRUCTIVE if executed as SQL queries.
Both scripts will destroy all tables matching the names used in Luper,
and then after that the create_ script will create new empty tables.

These scripts are to be accessed by LuperSQLiteHelper.java in the
onCreate and onUpgrade methods, respectively.  If executed outside
of this context, they will DELETE ALL THE DATA IN THE DATABASE.

Thanks,
Mike
