{"name":"Lüper","tagline":"Simple and Powerful Audio Sequencing on Android","body":"### **Lüper** is an audio sequencing app for Android with a focus on usability.  With Lüper, you can record, edit, and mix sounds from anywhere and share finished creations with others via Facebook.\r\n\r\nLüper was originally developed in Spring 2013 by students of the Software Engineering course (CS320) at UMass Amherst.  Some team members still actively maintain the project.  Team Lüper is:\r\n* Ben Foster\r\n* Brad Bullman\r\n* Cameron Smith\r\n* Eric Smith\r\n* Mike Turley\r\n* Josh Chudy\r\n* Steve Donahue\r\n* Sofya Vorotnikova\r\n* Xian Chen.\r\n\r\nThe app is still under active development and a 1.0 release is coming this May.\r\nThis site is not yet written, and the rest of the text is about github pages. This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
